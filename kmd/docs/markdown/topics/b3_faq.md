The philosophy behind Kmd is similar to Unix shell tools: simple commands that can be
combined in flexible and powerful ways.
It operates on "items" such as URLs, files, or Markdown notes within a workspace directory.
These items are processed by a variety of actions.

### How can I transcribe a YouTube video or podcast?

Here is an example of how to transcribe a YouTube video or podcast, then do some
summarization and editing of it.
(Click or copy/paste these commands.)

```shell
# Set up a workspace to test things out:
workspace fitness

# A short transcription:
transcribe 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRQnWomofIY'

# Take a look at the output:
show

# Now manipulate that transcription (note we are using the outputs of each previous command,
# which are auto-selected as input to each next command):
strip_html
break_into_paragraphs
summarize_as_bullets
create_pdf

# Note transcription works with multiple speakers:
transcribe 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUd7LleJuqM'

# Or all videos on a channel and then download and transcribe them all:
list_channel 'https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges'
transcribe

# Process a really long document (this one is a 3 hour interview) with sliding windows,
# and a sequence action that transcribes, formats, and includes timestamps for each
# paragraph:
transcribe_format 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juD99_sPWGU'

# Now look at these as a web page:
webpage_config
# Edit the config if desired:
edit
# Now generate the webpage:
webpage_generate
# And look at it in the browser:
show

# Combine more actions in a more complex combo action, adding paragraph annotations and headings:
transcribe_annotate_summarize 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRQnWomofIY'
show_as_webpage
```
