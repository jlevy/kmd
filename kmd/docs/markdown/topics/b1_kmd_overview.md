## Kmd Overview

Kmd is an extensible command-line tool for exploring and organizing knowledge.
It includes tasks like editing and summarizing text, transcribing videos, generating PDFs or
webpages, and more.

As with the Unix shell, the philosophy is to have simple commands that can be combined
flexibly in complex and powerful ways.
Inputs and outputs of commands are stored as files, so you can easily chain commands
together and inspect intermediate results.
When possible, actions are nondestructive and idempotent—that is, they will either create
new files or simply skip an operation if it's already complete.
Some slow actions (like downloading and transcribing videos) automatically produce cached
outputs (stored in the `kmd_cache` directory) to make things faster.

Kmd is built on top of xonsh, a Python-powered shell language.
This lets you run all Kmd commands, as well as have access to intelligent auto-complete.
In xonsh, you also have access to the full power of Python and the shell when needed.

On top of this, Kmd understands its own code and APIs and can help you use and even extend
it.
At any time you can ask a question and have the LLM-based assistant help you in how to use
Kmd.
Anything you type that ends in a `?` is sent to the assistant.

### Items and File Formats

Kmd operates on **items**, which are URLs, files, text or Markdown notes, or other
documents.
These are stored as simple files, in a single directory, called a **workspace**. Typically,
you want a workspace for a single topic or project.
By convention, workspace directories should have a `.kb` suffix, such as `fitness.kb`.

Within a workspace, files are organized into folders by type, including resources, notes,
configs, and exports.
Most text items are stored in Markdown format with YAML front matter (the same format used
by Jekyll or other static site generators), optionally with some HTML for structure if
needed.
But with Kmd you can process or export items in any other format you wish, like a PDF or a
webpage.

All items have a **source path**, which is simply the path of the file relative to the
workspace directory.
Item files are named in a simple and readable way, that reflects the title of the item, its
type, its format, and in some cases its provenance.
For example, `docs/day_1_workout_introduction_youtube_transcription_timestamps.doc.md` is an
item that is a doc (a text file) that is transcription of a YouTube video, including
timestamps, in Markdown format.

The path (directory and filename) each file is simply a convenient locator for the item.
The metadata on text items is in YAML metadata at the top of each file.
The metadata on items includes titles and item types, as you might expect, but also
provenance information, e.g. the URL where a page was downloaded from.
If an item is based on one or more other items (such as a summary that is based on an
original document), the sources are listed in a `derived_from` array within the `relations`
metadata.
This means actions can find citations or other data on the provenance of a given piece of
information.

### Commands and Actions

Most things are done via Kmd **commands**, which are built-in operations (like listing or
selecting files to process), and Kmd **actions**, which are an extensible set of
capabilities, like formatting documents, transcribing videos, or any arbitrary use of APIs.

Kmd actions are a set of operations that can operate on one or more items and produce one or
more new items.
Actions can invoke APIs, use LLMs, or perform any other operation that's scriptable in
Python.
You specify inputs to actions as URLs or source paths.

URLs that are provided as input and the output of actions are automatically stored as new
items in the workspace.
URLs or resources can be added manually, but this is normally not necessary.

Actions can be chained together in convenient ways.
The output of any command is always marked as the current **selection**, which is then
automatically available for input on a subsequent command.
This is sort of like Unix pipes, but is more convenient and incremental, and allows you to
sequence actions, multiple output items becoming the input of another action.

Actions also have **preconditions**, which reflect what kinds of content they can be run on.
For example, transcription only works on media URL resources, while summarization works on
readable text such as Markdown.
This catches errors and allows you to find actions that might apply to a given selected set
of items using `suggest_actions`.

### Useful Features

Kmd makes a few kinds of messy text manipulations easier:

- Reusable LLM actions: A common kind of action is to invoke an LLM (like GPT-4o or o1) on a
  text item, with a given system and user prompt template.
  New LLM actions can be added with a few lines of Python by subclassing an action base
  class, typically `Action`, `CachedItemAction` (for any action that doesn't need to be
  rerun if it has the same single output), `CachedLLMAction` (if it also is performing an
  LLM-based transform), or `ChunkedLLMAction` (if it will be processing a document broken
  into <div class="chunk"> elements).

- Sliding window transformations: LLMs can have trouble processing large inputs, not just
  because of context window and because they may make more mistakes when making lots of
  changes at once.
  Kmd supports running actions in a sliding window across the document, then stitching the
  results back together when done.

- Checking and enforcing changes: LLMs do not reliably do what they are asked to do.
  So a key part of making them useful is to save outputs at each step of the way and have a
  way to review their outputs or provide guardrails on what they can do with content.

- Fine-grainded diffs with word tokens: Documents can be represented at the word level,
  using “word tokens” to represent words and normalized whitespace (word, sentence, and
  paragraph breaks, but not line breaks).
  This allows diffs of similar documents regardless of formatting.
  For example, it is possible to ask an LLM only to add paragraph breaks, then drop any
  other changes it makes to other words.
  You can use this intelligent matching of words to “backfill” specific content from one doc
  into an edited document, such as pulling timestamps from a full transcript back into an
  edited transcript or summary.

- Paragraph and sentence operations: A lot of operations within actions should be done in
  chunks at the paragraph or sentence level.
  Kmd offers simple tools to subdivide documents into paragraphs and sentences and these can
  be used together with sliding windows to process large documents.

In addition, there are built-in Kmd commands that are part of the Kmd tool itself.
These allow you to list items in the workspace, see or change the current selection, archive
items, view logs, etc.
