## What is Kmd?

Kmd (“Knowledge comManD line”) is a power tool for practical knowledge tasks.
It’s an early prototype for the exploration of what’s possible with the myriad of AI
tools we now have.

Kmd makes it easier to use APIs and tools such as **OpenAI GPT-4o and o1**, **Anthropic
Claude 3.5**, **Groq Llama 3.1** (and any others via **LiteLLM**), **Deepgram**,
**Firecrawl**, **Exa**, **LlamaIndex**, **ChromaDB**, and other Python tools.

Use commands to transcribe videos, summarize and organize transcripts and notes, write
blog posts, extract or visualize concepts, check citations, convert notes to PDFs or
beautifully formatted HTML, or perform numerous other content-related tasks possible by
orchestrating AI tools in the right ways.
