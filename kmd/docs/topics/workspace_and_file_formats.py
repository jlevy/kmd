A kmd workspace is simply a directory of files. The goal is for a workspace to
be easy to use not just with kmd but with other editors or tools, so it's
possible to edit, share, or commit files to version control. It makes sense to
devote a workspace to a single topic, project, or area of research.

File formats and conventions:

- The workspace directory should have a `.kb` suffix, such as `fitness.kb`.

- A workspace holds items. Items are simply files. Files in a workspace are
  organized into folder by type, including resources, notes, configs, and
  exports.

- Files are named in the format
  `notes/day_1_workout_introduction_youtube_transcription_timestamps.note.md`.
  The file suffix indicates the item type (note, resource, etc.) and format
  (.md, .yml, etc.).

- Many items have metadata atached, giving an item type (see `ItemType` in the
  kmd item model), a format (see `Format`), a title, and other optinal fields
  like a URL (if the item is or is derived from an online URL) and a
  description.

- Text items are stored in Markdown format with YAML front matter to hold the
  metadata, in the style of Jekyll or other static site generators. The front
  matter is separated from the body with a `---` separator.

- Markdown in these items optionally may be pure Markdown or optionally contain
  HTML. A common use case is to add `<span>` or `<div>` tags to wrap sections of
  the document with semantic meaning. Any HTML can be used but some conventions
  are helpful:


  - Timestamps from a transcription: `<span data-timestamp="12.34">Some
    trancribed text.</span>`

  - Citations: `<span class="citation">⟦<a
    href="https://example.com">…</a>⟧</span>`

  - Block for a description: `<div class="description">…</div>`

  - Block for full text: ``<div class="full-text">…</div>`

- Pure text Markdown is usually stored in an auto-formatted normalized form.
  This enforces strict Markdown syntax conventions and makes it easy to read in
  the console and to diff. One detail with the Markdown format is that bullet
  point items are always written with two newlines between them. This makes
  chunking in LLMs easier, so that each bullet point is a separate paragraph.

- Resource items are often simply links to online resources such as a URL or
  YouTube video. These are stored as YAML frontmatter only (no body), with a
  title, description, URL and other fields.

- Config items are items where the body of the item is YAML. These are used to
  configure webpages or documents. Note that config items are have both YAML
  frontmatter (the metadata) and the YAML body (the content).

- Additional settings and data are stored in hidden directories (beginning with
  a `.`). The `.archive` directory contains archived items. The `.settings`
  directory contains settings, such as the current selection. The `.logs`
  directory contains logs.
